## Side Projects
- [Learn It Your Way](https://github.com/tbarlow12/Learn-It-Your-Way)

Robot starts as green and slowly fades to red as time is about to expire, then shakes violently when the time is up.
- [AskD](https://github.com/tbarlow12/Side-Projects/tree/master/AskD)

The documents also could have categories, keywords, titles, authors and other features. I implemented this lightweight desktop application in Java to quickly search by any of those attributes. She gave it the name AskD in honor of her own name.
