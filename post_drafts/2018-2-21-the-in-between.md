We've all been there. Talking with old friends or new acquaintances about your career as a software engineer, and those magic words pop into the conversation: _"Bro... I have an idea for this app..."_

I've heard my fair share of ideas through the years. Many of which actually had some merit; some of which I've actually pursued. 

My purpose here is not to disparage any idea. I think some of the best ideas in the world are those that sound insane from the start. My purpose is to reflect on one of my own experiences and what separates the successful ideas from... well... the others.

This experience I'm talking about was a time that I was able to witness the end to end process of an idea becoming a success. It started similarly to the other experiences I referenced in the beginning of this post - a friend came to me with an idea, and an ambitious one at that.

## The Idea

It was April of 2016. I was just about to finish one of the most difficult semesters I'd had to date. I was trying to understand Turing machines, Database relational algebra and every sorting algorithm ever made since the caveman stacked the biggest rocks at the bottom. I felt like I was drowning... while trying to read a textbook. 

In the heat of the confusion, rage and tears, this friend approached me with an idea to create the biggest hackathon in the state of Utah, that he wanted it to happen this coming semester and that he wanted me to help him do it. 

At the time, I thought, _"**How** could we ever do that? **Where** would we even find the time? **Why** put more on our plate than we already have?"_ It's safe to say I had my doubts. But after thinking about it for a few days, I thought it sounded kind of fun and that I'd join him. He recruited a few of our other classmates that were either crazy enough to say "yes" or too scared to tell him "no." We had ourselves a team.

Our first official meeting was a few weeks later, and was actually a video conference, as several of us were working at internships in different states. We jumped on the call and realized that none of us really knew any of the others, except for this friend that had pulled us into this. We weren't anti-social, but we each had our own spheres and didn't often venture outside them. 

I thought to myself, "This is quite possibly the most random sampling of students in the University of Utah Computer Science program..." Looking back, I realize some of the first differences between this idea and many of the others I'd heard:
 - **A *diverse* team** - Seriously, we could have been a poster for a University marketing campaign. We had just about every demographic covered. But diversity became much more than a box to check. A team with different backgrounds, perspectives, connections and opinions would become crucial to the success of the hackathon.
 - **The *right* people** - Rather than just pick his friends, he went out and picked people that would be right for each job and helped them catch



### The Minutiae

### The Sacrifice

### The Iteration

After a successful hackathon with very few hiccups, I thought we had earned a well-deserved rest. I was sure there were a few complaints here or there from participants and sponsors alike, but hey, in an event with 180+ participants and ~15 sponsors with several employees at the event each, there was bound to be at least _some_ whining. It wasn't that I didn't care, I just thought we had a little bit of time before we needed to worry about it again. My friend felt differently. After the feedback survey came back, he personally spoke with each sponsor, apologizing if necessary for any inconvenience and pledging to make the changes for the next year
