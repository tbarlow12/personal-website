title: The In-Between - What Makes an Idea Work
permalink: /the-in-between/

We've all been there. Talking with old friends or new acquaintances about your career as a software engineer, and those magical words pop into the conversation: _"Bro... I have an idea for this app..."_ Much to the surprise and chagrin of many aspiring Zuckerbergs, success comes from a heck of a lot more than just a good idea.

My purpose here is not to disparage any idea. I think some of the best ideas in the world are those that sound insane from the start. My purpose is to reflect on one of my own experiences and use it to identify some of the things that separate the successful ideas from... well... the others.

This experience I'm talking about was a time that I was able to witness the end to end process of an idea becoming a success. It started similarly to the other experiences I referenced in the beginning of this post - a friend came to me with an idea, and an ambitious one at that.

## The Idea

It was April of 2016. I was just about to finish one of the most difficult semesters I'd had to date. I was trying to understand Turing machines, Database relational algebra and every sorting algorithm ever made since the caveman stacked the biggest rocks at the bottom. I felt like I was drowning... while trying to read a textbook. 

In the heat of the confusion, rage and tears, this friend approached me with an idea to create the biggest hackathon in the state of Utah. He wanted it to happen in the upcoming semester (in 5 months) and that he wanted me to help him do it. 

At the time, I thought, _"**How** could we ever do that? **Where** would we even find the time? **Why** put more on our plate than we already have?"_ 

It's safe to say I had my doubts. But after thinking about it for a few days, I thought it sounded kind of fun and that I'd join him. He recruited a few of our other classmates that were either crazy enough to say "yes" or too scared to tell him "no." We had ourselves a team.

## The Team

Our first official meeting was a few weeks later, and was actually a video conference, as several of us were working at internships in different states. We jumped on the call and realized that none of us really knew any of the others, except for this friend that had pulled us into this. We weren't anti-social, but we each had our own spheres and didn't often venture outside them. 

I thought to myself, "This is quite possibly the most random possible sampling of students in the University of Utah Computer Science program..." Looking back, I realize that these were some of the first indications of differences between this idea and many of the others I'd heard:
- **A *diverse* team** - Seriously, we could have been a poster for a University marketing campaign. We had just about every demographic covered. But diversity became much more than a box to check. A team with different backgrounds, perspectives, connections and opinions would become crucial to the success of the hackathon.
- **The *right* people** - Rather than just pick his friends, he went out and picked people that would be right for each job and helped them catch the vision. I'm not saying people on the team weren't his friends, but I think it's easy to fall into the trap of just defaulting to your circle of closest friends, even if they're not right for the job.

## The Minutiae

We each went about our duties, as busy as we were. We did our best to attend weekly meetings on our progress, where we'd identify any blockers and discuss solutions. It was *a lot* of work for everyone involved.

We had team members over categories like Marketing, Social Media, Hospitality, Sponsorship, and others. I was the Director of Technology, which meant I would be responsible for the hardware lab, coordinating the schedule and tasks for all of our volunteers and oversee any technical mentoring that was needed.

However, when it came time for the event, even though we still each owned our piece of the pie, we all pitched in to help each other and make it happen.

No one was above helping anyone else with any activity. We all

## The Sacrifice

## The Iteration

After a successful hackathon with very few hiccups, I thought we had earned a well-deserved rest. I was sure there were a few complaints here or there from participants and sponsors alike, but hey, in an event with 180+ participants and ~15 sponsors several employees each, there was bound to be at least _some_ whining. 

It wasn't that I didn't care, I just thought we had a little bit of time before we needed to worry about it again. My friend felt differently. After the feedback survey came back, he personally spoke with each sponsor, apologizing if necessary for any inconvenience and pledging to make the changes for the next year. I watched as those items of feedback tormented him over the next year, giving each one a great deal of time and attention, making sure no one would be able to raise that complaint again.

In other words, he made this idea different by: 
- *Not only accepting, but **seeking** honest feedback* - It wasn't enough to pat himself on the back for a job well done and rest up. He *needed*
